# web-scraper

This is a simple web scraper to scrape information from https://publiclibraries.com/, specifically from the tables containing information about all of
the states libraries.  The application scrapes the web page and puts the information into a google sheet.  I made this to help with a temporary 
job I had that involved making a list of all libraries in the USA
